        <h1>📖 Web Development Fundamentals</h1>
        <p><em>Complete Learning Guide for Beginners</em></p>

        <h2>1. Introduction to Web Development</h2>
        <p>
            Web development is the process of building and maintaining websites. It encompasses everything from 
            creating simple static pages to complex web applications, social network services, and electronic 
            business applications. Web development can be divided into two main categories: 
            <span class="highlight">frontend development</span> and <span class="highlight">backend development</span>.
        </p>

        <h3>1.1 Frontend Development</h3>
        <p>
            Frontend development refers to everything that users interact with directly in their web browser. 
            This includes the layout, design, and interactivity of a website. The three core technologies used 
            in frontend development are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        </p>

        <div class="code-block">
            &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;<br>
            &lt;html&gt;<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;head&gt;<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;title&gt;My First Page&lt;/title&gt;<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/head&gt;<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;body&gt;<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;h1&gt;Hello World!&lt;/h1&gt;<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/body&gt;<br>
            &lt;/html&gt;
        </div>

        <div class="page-break"></div>

        <h2>2. HTML - HyperText Markup Language</h2>
        <p>
            HTML is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It describes the structure of web pages 
            using markup. HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages and are represented by tags.
        </p>

        <h3>2.1 Basic HTML Structure</h3>
        <p>
            Every HTML document follows a standard structure that includes the document type declaration, 
            an html element, a head section for metadata, and a body section for content. Understanding this 
            structure is fundamental to creating well-formed web pages.
        </p>

        <h3>2.2 Common HTML Elements</h3>
        <p>
            HTML provides numerous elements for different purposes: headings (h1-h6), paragraphs (p), 
            links (a), images (img), lists (ul, ol, li), and divisions (div). Each element serves a 
            specific purpose in structuring your content semantically.
        </p>

        <div class="page-break"></div>

        <h2>3. CSS - Cascading Style Sheets</h2>
        <p>
            CSS is used to style and layout web pages. It allows you to change colors, fonts, spacing, 
            and much more. CSS works by selecting HTML elements and applying styles to them through 
            a set of properties and values.
        </p>

        <h3>3.1 CSS Selectors</h3>
        <p>
            Selectors are patterns used to select the elements you want to style. The most common types 
            include element selectors, class selectors (.), ID selectors (#), and attribute selectors. 
            Understanding selectors is crucial for effective styling.
        </p>

        <div class="code-block">
            /* Element selector */<br>
            p { color: blue; }<br><br>
            /* Class selector */<br>
            .highlight { background-color: yellow; }<br><br>
            /* ID selector */<br>
            #header { font-size: 24px; }
        </div>

        <h3>3.2 The Box Model</h3>
        <p>
            The CSS box model describes the rectangular boxes generated for elements in the document tree. 
            Each box has content, padding, border, and margin areas. Understanding the box model is essential 
            for creating layouts and controlling spacing.
        </p>

        <div class="page-break"></div>

        <h2>4. JavaScript Basics</h2>
        <p>
            JavaScript is a programming language that enables interactive web pages. It allows you to 
            implement complex features like updating content dynamically, animating images, controlling 
            multimedia, and much more. JavaScript is the third layer of the web development cake.
        </p>

        <h3>4.1 Variables and Data Types</h3>
        <p>
            JavaScript variables can be declared using var, let, or const. Each has different scoping rules. 
            JavaScript supports various data types including numbers, strings, booleans, objects, and arrays. 
            Understanding data types is fundamental to writing effective JavaScript code.
        </p>

        <div class="code-block">
            let name = "John Doe";<br>
            const age = 25;<br>
            var isStudent = true;
        </div>

        <h3>4.2 Functions</h3>
        <p>
            Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. They can accept parameters 
            and return values. Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript and are 
            essential for organizing and reusing code.
        </p>

        <div class="page-break"></div>

        <h2>5. Web Development Best Practices</h2>
        <p>
            Following best practices ensures your code is maintainable, accessible, and performs well. 
            This includes writing semantic HTML, organizing CSS efficiently, following JavaScript naming 
            conventions, and ensuring your sites are responsive and accessible.
        </p>

        <h3>5.1 Semantic HTML</h3>
        <p>
            Using semantic HTML means using HTML elements for their intended purpose. This makes your 
            content more accessible to screen readers and helps search engines understand your content better. 
            Examples include using &lt;nav&gt; for navigation, &lt;article&gt; for articles, and 
            &lt;aside&gt; for sidebars.
        </p>

        <h3>5.2 Responsive Design</h3>
        <p>
            Responsive design ensures your website works well on all devices and screen sizes. This is 
            achieved through fluid grids, flexible images, and CSS media queries. With the increasing 
            variety of devices accessing the web, responsive design has become essential.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            Web development is an exciting and constantly evolving field. By mastering HTML, CSS, and 
            JavaScript, you'll have the foundation needed to create modern, interactive websites. 
            Continue practicing, building projects, and staying updated with new technologies to grow 
            as a web developer.
